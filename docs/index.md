This website is a browser for the Matlab programs provided with Gordon Bonan's textbook [Climate Change and Terrestrial Ecosystem Modeling](http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/staff/bonan/ecomod/index.html) (2019, Cambridge University Press).

The official code repository of Supplemental Programs is at [gbonan/bonanmodeling](https://github.com/gbonan/bonanmodeling). 

This site provides the following benefits over simply browsing the official code repository on GitHub:
* search bar
* outputs (figures and text) produced by running the programs
* organization by chapter, with chapter titles, to aid in finding relevant programs
